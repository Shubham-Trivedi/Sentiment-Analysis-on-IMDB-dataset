# Sentiment-Analysis-on-IMDB-dataset

In this project, weâ€™ll use an IMDB dataset of 50k movie reviews available on Kaggle. The dataset contains 2 columns (review and sentiment) that will help us identify whether a review is positive or negative.
<p><b> <i>Problem formulation</i>: Our goal is to find which machine learning model is best suited to predict sentiment (output) given a movie review (input).</p></b>
